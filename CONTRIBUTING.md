# Contributing to Pushpaka Vimana
**Project Lead: Varshith Regonda**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Solar-Argon Pushpaka project. We are working to prove the viability of Tesla-propulsion in micro-UAVs.

## 🛠 Areas of Contribution
We are looking for experts and hobbyists to help with:

### 1. Geometric Optimization (Physics)
We need to refine the gap between the Tesla discs ($b \approx 0.5\text{mm}$) for different atmospheric pressures. If you have experience in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), please share your findings.

### 2. Gold-Path Engineering (Electronics)
We are seeking optimized PCB layouts that prioritize gold-plated surface area to handle high-current draws from the Tesla motor without heat buildup.

### 3. LW-PLA Fuzzy Skin Calibration (Aerodynamics)
If you have discovered specific 3D print settings (Cura/PrusaSlicer) that improve dust-repellency on the LW-PLA skin, please submit your profiles.

## 🚀 How to Submit Changes
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create your **Feature Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingUpdate`).
3. **Commit** your changes (ensure math formulas are in LaTeX).
4. Open a **Pull Request** for Varshith Regonda to review.
