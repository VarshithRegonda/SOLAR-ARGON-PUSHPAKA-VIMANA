## 🎯 Project Overview

**Pushpaka Vimana** is an open-source micro-UAV research project inspired by ancient Indian aeronautical imagination and executed strictly using **modern aerospace engineering principles**.

Named after the legendary *Pushpaka Vimana* from Sanskrit literature, this project aims to **bridge cultural inspiration with practical engineering**, resulting in a reproducible **1:10 scale flying prototype**.

The project emphasizes **feasibility, safety, transparency, and education**, not speculative or unsafe propulsion claims.

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

Build a **cost-effective, reproducible micro-UAV** that:

- ✈️ Achieves **2–5 minutes** sustained controlled flight  
- 🇮🇳 Uses **locally sourced Indian components**  
- 💰 Fits within **₹8,000–₹12,000** total budget  
- 📐 Includes **complete engineering documentation**  
- 🔓 Remains **fully open-source (Apache 2.0)**  
- 🛡️ Prioritizes **safety and repeatability**

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

### 1. Biomimetic Engineering
- Peacock-feather-inspired **micro-textured surface**
- Focus on airflow smoothing, dust resistance, and aesthetics

### 2. Ancient–Modern Synthesis
- Cultural inspiration from *Pushpaka Vimana*
- Engineering governed strictly by **modern physics & aerospace standards**

### 3. Practical Engineering
- **LiPo battery as primary power** (solar as auxiliary/experimental)
- No hazardous or toxic materials
- Honest trade-offs over speculative claims

### 4. Open Science
- Transparent calculations
- Reproducible build steps
- Public design files and test results

### 5. Community-First Approach
- India-specific sourcing
- Student- and hobbyist-friendly design
