## 📖 Introduction
The **Pushpaka Project** is an open-source engineering initiative to develop a sustainable, high-efficiency drone. This design replaces traditional propellers with a **Tesla Turbine** (Vortex Engine) and uses **Argon gas** simulation to achieve high-stability flight in high-dust environments.

### 🔬 Core Innovations
* **Tesla-Argon Drive:** Uses boundary-layer fluid mechanics instead of blades to move air, reducing mechanical wear and noise.
* **Biomimetic "Fuzzy" Skin:** A randomized 3D-printed surface texture that prevents fine dust from bonding to the airframe.
* **Gold-Path Circuitry:** All electrical junctions are gold-plated to ensure zero oxidation and minimal resistance during high-heat operation.

## 📐 Engineering & Physics
This prototype is built on the following scientific principles:

#### 1. Solar Energy Conversion
$$P_{sol} = A \cdot 1000 \cdot \eta \cdot 0.95$$
*Optimized for high solar irradiance using high-efficiency flexible panels.*

#### 2. Fluid Momentum (Tesla Effect)
Propulsion is generated by the viscous drag of Argon gas between parallel disks:
$$\tau = 2\pi \rho \nu \omega \int_{r_i}^{r_o} r^3 dr$$
