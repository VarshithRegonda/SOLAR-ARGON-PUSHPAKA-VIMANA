## 🎯 Project Overview

**Pushpaka Vimana** is an open-source micro-UAV research project inspired by ancient Indian aeronautical imagination and executed using modern aerospace engineering principles.

Named after the legendary *Pushpaka Vimana* from Sanskrit literature, this project aims to **bridge cultural inspiration with practical engineering**, resulting in a reproducible 1:10 scale flying prototype built within 60 days.

The project emphasizes **feasibility, safety, transparency, and education** rather than speculative or unsafe propulsion claims.

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

Build a **cost-effective, reproducible micro-UAV** that:

* ✈️ Achieves **2–5 minutes sustained controlled flight**
* 🇮🇳 Uses **locally sourced Indian components**
* 💰 Fits within **₹8,000–₹12,000** total budget
* 📐 Includes **complete engineering documentation**
* 🔓 Remains **fully open-source (Apache 2.0)**
* ⚡ Is completed within a **60-day timeline**
* 🛡️ Prioritizes **safety and repeatability**

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

### 1. Biomimetic Engineering

* Peacock-feather-inspired **micro-textured surface**
* Focus on dust resistance, airflow smoothing, and aesthetics

### 2. Ancient–Modern Synthesis

* Cultural inspiration from *Pushpaka Vimana*
* Engineering strictly based on **modern physics and aerospace standards**

### 3. Practical Engineering

* **LiPo battery as primary power** (solar as auxiliary/experimental)
* No hazardous or toxic materials
* Honest trade-offs over speculative claims

### 4. Open Science

* Transparent calculations
* Reproducible build steps
* Public design files and test results

### 5. Community-First Approach

* India-specific sourcing
* Student- and hobbyist-friendly build
